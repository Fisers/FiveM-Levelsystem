# FiveM-Levelsystem
Very simple script I created, which adds levels to the game server, increases them every hour and saves in the mysql database.
Also it gives all online players a paycheck depending on their job and salary.

## Requires
- "essentialmode.sql" to be imported in the database
- [mysql-async](https://github.com/brouznouf/fivem-mysql-async) plugin
